# network-monitoring
Python tool for monitoring host availability (ICMP/TCP) with logging and basic network troubleshooting

# Network Monitoring Tool (Python)

## Overview
This project provides a Python-based tool for automated host availability checks using ICMP (ping) and TCP connections.

It is designed to help administrators detect connectivity issues, identify outages and support basic troubleshooting in small or medium-sized network environments.

## Project Goals
- Automate reachability checks of network devices
- Detect connection losses and status changes
- Apply fundamental TCP/IP knowledge in practical scenarios
- Provide clear and structured diagnostic output

## Features
- ICMP ping tests
- TCP port connectivity checks
- Logging of host status (UP/DOWN)
- Simple and extendable architecture
- Designed for administrative troubleshooting tasks

## Technologies & Concepts
- Python
- TCP/IP networking
- ICMP
- Client-server connectivity
- Basic monitoring principles

## How to run
```bash
python main.py
